A light wrapper for aws-xray-sdk-java.

## Why

aws-xray-sdk-java heavily use thread local storage and mutations, which can cause
lots of accidental complexity when beginning and ending segments / subsegments.

This library tries to mitigate the problem by making sure that the thread local
context is set before any operations.

## Usage

For synchronous execution

```clj
(require '[aws-xray-sdk-clj.core :as core])

(def trace-id (core/root-trace-id http-header-string))

(with-open [segment (core/begin! core/global-recorder {:trace-id trace-id
                                                       :name     "foo"})]
  (core/set-annotation! segment {:foo "bar"})
  (core/with-open [subsegment (core/begin! segment {:name "baz"})]
    (core/set-annotation! subsegment {:bar "baz"})))
```

For asynchronous codes

```clj
(require '[promesa.core :as promesa])
(require '[aws-xray-sdk-clj.promise :refer [with-segment]])

;; A light wrapper around promesa/finally
@(with-segment [segment (core/begin! recorder {:trace-id trace-id
                                               :name     "bar"})]
   (promesa/delay 10 "foobar"))
```

## Note

When unit testing on a machine that doesn't have a XRay agent running,
you might want to override the default UDP emitter to prevent errors.

```clj
(:import [com.amazonaws.xray.emitters Emitter])

(def mock-emitter
  (proxy [Emitter][]
    (sendSegment [x]
      true)

    (sendSubsegment [x]
      true)))

(def recorder (core/recorder {:emitter mock-emitter}))
```
