 [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hden/aws-xray-sdk-clj/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=YHH1W6IGIW)](https://codecov.io/gh/hden/aws-xray-sdk-clj) [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.github.hden/aws-xray-sdk-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.github.hden/aws-xray-sdk-clj)

A light wrapper for aws-xray-sdk-java.

## Why

> High mutability and circular refrences between segments and subsegments create a prime landscape for thread issues. -- https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-java/pull/306#issue-1011630726

This library tries to mitigate the problems by making sure that the thread local
context is set before any operations.

## Usage

For synchronous execution

```clj
(require '[aws-xray-sdk-clj.core :as core])

(def trace-id (core/root-trace-id http-header-string))

(core/with-open [segment (core/start! core/global-recorder {:trace-id trace-id
                                                            :name     "foo"})]
  (core/set-annotation! segment {:foo "bar"})
  (core/with-open [subsegment (core/start! segment {:name "baz"})]
    (core/set-annotation! subsegment {:bar "baz"})))
```

For asynchronous codes

```clj
(require '[promesa.core :as promesa])
(require '[aws-xray-sdk-clj.promise :refer [with-segment]])

;; A light wrapper around promesa/finally
@(with-segment [segment (core/start! recorder {:trace-id trace-id
                                               :name     "bar"})]
   (promesa/delay 10 "foobar"))
```

## Note

When unit testing on a machine that doesn't have a XRay agent running,
you might want to override the default UDP emitter to prevent errors.

```clj
(:import [com.amazonaws.xray.emitters Emitter])

(def mock-emitter
  (proxy [Emitter][]
    (sendSegment [x]
      true)

    (sendSubsegment [x]
      true)))

(def recorder (core/recorder {:emitter mock-emitter}))
```
